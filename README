This is a repository containing build files needed to build my CPAN
modules from the git repository.

My CPAN ID is BKB, and my github ID is benkasminbullock.

The contents are copied here from other directories by the script
"copy.pl". It doesn't copy the documentation or other supporting
files, only the bits of code which are needed to build from the git
repositories.

If you need the documentation, email me at benkasminbullock@gmail.com
or bkb@cpan.org, or put an issue in or something.
