This is a repository containing build files needed to build my CPAN
modules from the git repository.

You do not need these files to build from the CPAN repository, so if
you are only interested in installing one of my modules then please
use cpanm or what have you as usual to do that, e.g.

	cpanm JSON::Parse

etc.

My CPAN ID is BKB, and my github ID is benkasminbullock.

This is not the central repository of my non-distributed modules. The
contents of this repository are copied here from other directories of
my local system by the script "copy.pl". This script doesn't copy the
documentation or other supporting files, only the bits of code which
are needed to build from the git repositories.

If you need the documentation, email me at benkasminbullock@gmail.com
or bkb@cpan.org, or put an issue in or something.
